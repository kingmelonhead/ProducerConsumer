-------- Description    ------------

This program solves the producer consumer problem using a monitor.
The program has a few different options that you can use to edit how the program executes.

The monitor is implemented using semaphores and shared memory. Mutual exclusion is obtained by keeping critical 
routines inside the monitor and only allowing 1 process at a time into the monitor. 

In my program specifically, the "product" that was produced was just some random number, that was then written to the buffer.

Then, consuming was simply taking that number from the bufer and outputting that it was taken to the log

This seemed to have been left up to interpretation as far as what to produce so I decided to keep it simple

The monitor functions by utilizing a driver file and a shared library of functions that was turned to a static linked
library. This allowed all of the executables to use the shared functions.


--------  Instructions   --------

How to invoke program: monitor [-h] [-o logfile] [-p m] [-c n] [-t time]

Options:

[-h]		    -This option is how the program was run to display this menu. Program outputs help menu and exits.

[-i] logfile    -This option allows the user to change the name of the logfile. (max of 20 chars)

[-p] m		    -This option allows the user to override the default number of producers.

[-c] n		    -This option allows the user to override the default number of consumers.

[-t] time	    -This option allows the user to override the default max execution time allowed.

------- Changes / Assumptions ------

My program has a hard cap on the number of producers allowed. I set it to 18. The project doesnt 
explicitly say to do this. However, the nature of the producer functions makes them not die, so this makes
it so at most there is only ever:  monitor + 18 producers + 1 consumer, keeping the process count under the 
20 process limit. This doesnt lead to any issues outside of longer run time. The consumers, while only 1 is allowd
at a time in that worst case scenario, they will still be able to spawn, carry out their job, and exit in a 
reasonable time and without errors. 

-------- Complications -------------

I didnt really have any issues during the production of this projects. The semaphores and everything actually worked 
first try.
